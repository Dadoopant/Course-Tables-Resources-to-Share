                    <strong>Physical:</strong> Highway will be protected (projected); development setbacks enforced; addresses root cause. <strong>Economic:</strong> Highway maintenance costs reduced long-term; some property devaluation near coast. <strong>Social:</strong> Minimal displacement (few residents near highway); <strong style="color: #c53030;">concern about future development patterns and service worker housing.</strong> <strong>Sustainability:</strong> One-time infrastructure move avoids perpetual maintenance; sustainable approach.

                <strong>Molotch:</strong> Growth machine CAN make rational adaptation choices when resources available; shifts infrastructure to preserve development potential rather than fighting nature.<br>
                <strong>Harvey:</strong> Public infrastructure prioritized over private beachfront property. BUT: Who has "right" to coast? Beachfront owners lose beach access value.<br>
                <strong>Fainstein:</strong> <strong style="color: #c53030;">MIXED on Just City criteria—Democracy in process (public planning), equity QUESTIONABLE (who bears costs of lost beach access? Service workers still priced out of housing in area), diversity unclear.</strong><br>
                <strong>KEY QUESTION:</strong> Is this "success" or just wealthy people's problems being solved with public funds while service workers remain vulnerable?
