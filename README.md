This repository hosts static HTML pages in the `docs/` folder and publishes them via GitHub Pages.

How to publish
1. Add any static file (HTML, CSS, images) to `docs/` (for example `docs/autumn_comparison_table_4quadrant.html`).
2. Commit and push to branch `main`.
3. The included GitHub Actions workflow will publish `docs/` to GitHub Pages automatically.

Shareable URL format
https://Dadoopant.github.io/Course-Tables-Resources-to-Share/<filename>.html

Notes
- I recommend using underscores instead of spaces in filenames (e.g., `autumn_comparison_table_4quadrant.html`) so URLs are nicer.
- If you want me to push your pages after you create the initial `main` branch, reply here “main created” and I’ll add the docs and workflow.
